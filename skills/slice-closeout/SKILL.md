name: slice-closeout
description: HIGH PRIORITY. Use this skill to finish every implementation slice. It mandates "green status clearing" (verified build/test/smokes), updates to docs/task.md, and explicit disposition updates for touched architecture proposals. No slice is complete until this operational close-out is recorded and committed.

# Slice Closeout

Scope: General.

Use this skill only for end-of-slice operational closure in any SVE-compliant repo.

This skill owns:

- Proposal disposition updates tied to a just-completed slice
- `docs/task.md` updates tied to that slice
- verification-level summary for that slice
- reality-gap capture from that slice
- commit/push discipline for that slice
- naming the next seam after that slice

This skill does not own:

- general proposal editing across arbitrary projects
- deep runtime investigation
- choosing the verification strategy from scratch

Use [$proposal-maintainer](../proposal-maintainer/SKILL.md) for generic proposal upkeep.
Use [$architecture-docs-maintainer](../architecture-docs-maintainer/SKILL.md) when the slice changed architecture truth, active seams, frontmatter metadata, or docs entrypoints.
Use [$verification-ladder](../verification-ladder/SKILL.md) when the main job is deciding validation depth.
Use [$runtime-debugger](../runtime-debugger/SKILL.md) when the main job is finding a live runtime failure.

## Workflow

1. Identify the slice boundary.
2. Update the relevant architecture proposal `Disposition`.
3. Update `docs/task.md` for completed work and real follow-ups.
4. If architecture docs moved, run the `architecture-docs-maintainer` pass:
   - update `ARCHITECTURE_STATUS.md` if current truth changed
   - update `ARCHITECTURE.md` if durable reference changed
   - ensure metadata/domains/links still align
5. Summarize the highest honest verification level.
6. Record assumption-vs-reality gaps exposed by the slice.
7. Commit and push one coherent slice.
8. State the next seam.

## Output Expectations

Report:

- what is working
- what remains intentionally incomplete
- the verification level
- the commit hash
- the next seam
