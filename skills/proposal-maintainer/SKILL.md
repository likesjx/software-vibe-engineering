name: proposal-maintainer
description: HIGH PRIORITY. Use this skill to keep architecture and process proposals concise, current, and linked to active tasks. A proposal is not a static doc; it is an active plan. Trigger for disposition updates, task alignment, or removing stale certainty. Pair this with architecture-docs-maintainer when metadata, domains, or source-of-truth linkage also need upkeep.

# Proposal Maintainer

Scope: General.

Use this skill for proposal and spec hygiene across projects.

This skill owns:

- tightening proposal structure
- adding or updating `Disposition`
- adding links to active task/work-item tracking
- clarifying implemented vs deferred vs superseded status
- trimming stale or overly broad narrative

This skill does not own:

- per-slice commit/push workflow
- repo-specific task-board closure unless it directly supports proposal accuracy
- runtime debugging or validation decisions

Use `slice-closeout` when the main job is closing an implementation slice.
Use [$architecture-docs-maintainer](../architecture-docs-maintainer/SKILL.md) when the proposal edit also changes frontmatter, domain assignment, status-doc linkage, or docs index routing.
Use [$verification-ladder](../verification-ladder/SKILL.md) when the main job is choosing or reporting validation depth.

## Workflow

1. Identify the proposal's job.
2. Check whether it needs a `Disposition`, `Current Slice`, or task links.
3. Tighten the recommendation and remove stale certainty.
4. Align the document with implemented, accepted, deferred, or superseded reality.
5. Link to the authoritative work surface.
6. Hand off to `architecture-docs-maintainer` if the proposal change also affects metadata, domains, source-of-truth docs, or task/status cross-links.

## Output Expectations

Report:

- what was clarified
- what status/disposition changed
- which work items or tasks are linked
- any stale sections still worth cleaning later
